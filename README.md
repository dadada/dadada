# 🦄 Hi, I'm Tim ✨

See [git.dadada.li](https://git.dadada.li) for a more complete list of my past and present projects.

My educational background is mostly in computer networks and protocol design and analysis. Other interests include software architecture, programming languages and infrastructure as code.

I build apps and infrastructure at [IServ GmbH](https://github.com/IServ-GmbH) in Braunschweig and like to play around with [NixOS](https://github.com/NixOS/), to which I occasionally try to contribute some things back.
